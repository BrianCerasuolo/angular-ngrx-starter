# Angular Ngrx Starter

*An opiniated Angular setup based on @angular/cli*

[Angular-Cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) can help you start an Angular project very quickly.

But when you need a lot of external modules/libs and you've got to setup everything, everytime, it can be quite long and repetitive.

**This setup has the following modules already installed and configured :**  
- Angular Material  
- Material Design Icons  
- Ng2 Translate  
- Ngrx  
  - Store  
  - Effects  
  - StoreDevtools
- Jest (instead of Karma)

If you don't know angular-cli, please read the doc.

I added one command to build the project as small as possible for production : `yarn run prod`.

If you're new to ngrx [store | effects], it might help you get started.
I've put a lot of comments and a folder called "pizzas" for demo/scaffolding.

Don't forget to install and take a look to [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) for state debugging.
